My first github repository

I have just finished my sophomore year at Ohio State.
Unfortunately, I lost my internship for the summer as a result of the Coronavirus outbreak.
My plan now for the summmer now is to expand my knowledge as a programmer on my own by learning new languages
and sharpening my professional image as a candidate by creating a github profile, for example
